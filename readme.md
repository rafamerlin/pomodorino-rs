Pomodorino
---

Very simplistic pomodoro tray app made using Rust and Tauri

I recommend to check the technique in more details on the [official website](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique)

Currently the release has versions for Windows, Linux and Intel Macs.

It will work on Silicon macs as well but you'll need to build it yourself for now.
