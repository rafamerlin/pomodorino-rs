Pomodorino
---

Very simplistic pomodoro tray app made using Rust and Tauri

I recommend to check the technique in more details on the [official website](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique)

Should be working on windows, linux and mac.

For Linux to work we need it to generate all the icons that will be used, so it will try to generate them on the same folder of the executable.

I'm not generating any builds for this one. So I recommend checking this on how to generate your own installer:
